# Climate Change EDA Project

## Objective:
To applicate EDA concept related to time series that I have learned from class lecture [SDSC3011 - Social Data Processing and Modelling](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/catalogue/ug/current/course/SDSC3011.htm).

## Key Points:
1. Tidy the messy data
2. Visualize time series data
